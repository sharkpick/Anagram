                This project is a simple anagram maker. It can either look for 
                "straight" anagrams (anagrams containing exactly the same set
                of characters) or can include partial matches, which looks at
                all permutations of the inputted word to find any possible anagram,
                regardless of how many characters it has.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how it works:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On launch our server (written in Go) will read a dictionary
                        file. The dictionary file is our local shared dictionary file
                        (/usr/share/dict/words on ubuntu).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The dictionary file is parsed into valid words (here we exclude
                        words with any characters that aren't a-z or A-Z). The words 
                        are split and sorted, and a map is constructed linking these 
                        sorted strings to slices of matches (simple strings). The slices
                        are kept sorted for convenience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The server also has a handler that accepts input from the form on
                        index.html. It takes a word to search and an option, then returns
                        a .json representation of the results, grouped by word length.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The rest is written in HTML/javascript with some CSS to make it 
                        look nice. The form on index.html calls a javascript function to
                        check with the server for results. Results are presented on the 
                        index page above the form, sorted by word length.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The function who controls this clears the body before running 
                        each time so that the results don't stack up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

    </body>
